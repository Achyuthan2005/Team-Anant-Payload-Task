Task1) Binning is done to improve the image resolution

Task2) The code loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, initializes a logistic regression model, trains it on the training data, predicts the labels for the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

Logistic regression is a powerful and widely-used algorithm for classification tasks, but it has some limitations. For example, logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the response variable, which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios with complex and non-linear relationships.
